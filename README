******  Estuary release 2.0 ******

These are the release notes for the Estuary new version. Please read them carefully, as they tell you what this is all about, explain how to get, build, and run it.


1. Introduction 
=================

  Estuary is a totally open source version of the whole software solution which target is the ICT market. It is a long term solution and focus on the combination of the high level components. And It is expected to be rebased from the newest version of the community quickly.
  You need do some preparation to get all target binaries before you booting system, and you are supposedly using Ubunt newer than 12.04 as your host OS. (But only Ubuntu 12.04 is validated)

2. Components
================

- Toolchain
  This part is about the cross compiler for the arm platform. Now we directly use the binary downloaded from the Linaro as follow.

  URL: http://www.linaro.org/downloads/

- UEFI
  This part is about the boot loader, now we use the UEFI as the bootloader. 
  The UEFI source code for D02 is not public currently, maybe we will publish it later, but now we can only provide binaries for D02.
  
  The source code for D01, you can get it by following commands:
  	$git clone http://git.linaro.org/git/uefi/linaro-edk2.git
  ...or
  	$git clone https://github.com/open-estuary/uefi.git

- Grub
  This part is also about the boot loader. Grub can run in the UEFI, and supply some advanced function. We get the source code from the community.
  You can get it by following command:
  	$git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/grub.git

- Linux Kernel
  This part is about the OS kernel, the latest version can support D01 or D02 boards, etc. 
  
  The latest avaible Kernel source code for estuary project is provided in following git repository by a branch named "estuary":
  github: https://github.com/open-estuary/kernel.git  
  
  You can always get the latest version by following command:
	$git clone https://github.com/open-estuary/kernel.git
  ...or get it with a special tag by following command:
	$git clone https://github.com/open-estuary/kernel.git -b refs/tags/estuary-vx.x

- Distributions
  This part is about the rootfs of several distibutions (OpenEmbedded, Debian, Ubuntu, OpenSuse and Fedora). All of them can be downloaded from their official website.

- QEMU
  This part is about the virtual platform. The QEMU (Quick EMUlater) can
  emulate the ARMv8 virtual machine on the x86 host machine, so we can use the
  virtual platform to do the validation of the common part for the whole
  software solution. We now get the source code from the community. You can get
  it by following command:
  	$git clone git://git.qemu-project.org/qemu.git

- Binaries
  You can get most binary files of above components from this project's release as follow, apart from tool chain, distributions and qemu.

3. Status
================

  In this version, the software solution are validated with the D01 boards,
  QEMU ARMv8 platform, the P660 EVB board and D02 board.
  Now the validated components are as following:
	- Toolchain
	- UEFI (only for D01)
	- UEFI\trust fw (only for D02)
	- GRUB2 (for D01, D02)
	- Linux Kernel
	- Distributions
	- QEMU


4. Fetching and Building
================
  How to fetch our whole solution and how to use it? This part will answer
  these questions.

 4.1 Preparation
  You need download repo by following commands:
	$mkdir -p ~/bin
	$curl "https://android-git.linaro.org/gitweb?p=tools/repo.git;a=blob_plain;f=repo;hb=refs/heads/stable" > ~/bin/repo
	$chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
	$echo 'export PATH=~/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
	$export PATH=~/bin:$PATH

 4.2 Obtain whole project
  Create a work directory by following commands:
	$mkdir workdir
	$cd workdir

  Download the whole project resource by following commands:
  	$repo init -u https://github.com/open-estuary/estuary.git --no-repo-verify --repo-url=git://android.git.linaro.org/tools/repo
 	$repo sync
	If it fails during repo sync, you can just try to do 'repo sync' again.

 4.3 Build it
  Finally, build the estuary and run it on QEMU, D01, D02 or P660 EVB board. The
  build.sh is used to do it. 

  If want to read the help message, can type this commond:
  	$./estuary/build.sh -h
  
  Here is the example for running the Ubuntu with ARMv8 QEMU platform:
	$./estuary/build.sh -p QEMU -d Ubuntu

  Here is the example for building the Ubuntu target system for D01 board:
	$./estuary/build.sh -p D01 -d Ubuntu

  Here is the example for building the Ubuntu target system for D02 board:
	$./estuary/build.sh -p D02 -d Ubuntu

  Here is the example for building the Fedora target system for D02 board:
	$./estuary/build.sh -p D02 -d Fedora

  After building, you will find all target files in 'build' directory.

5. Deployment
================
